<h1>Photography</h1>
<p>
A love-hate relationship... there are times when I completely immerse myself in 
the act of taking photos as I experiment with various camera settings,
trying out different angles, distances and compositions under a variety of light conditions. 
But it often turns out to be a lonely solo endeavour, cutting out social interactions
where I take on the role of observer raher than active participant.
<p>
There are times when I would rather enjoy the moment without thinking about photography,
without trying to "capture the moment", when I would prefer to socialise and participate.
But then I often end up regretting not having any visual memories of the places I've visited
or activities I've witnessed...

So, photography is a part-time amateur hobby for me - not something that I've ever 
wanted to do do full-time professionally.
And I have been fairly disciplined in avoiding "GAS" (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) that affects 
so many amateur photographers and becomes a drain on finances.
