<br>
<h2>Skills</h2>
Having started my career in electronic engineering, I soon switched to software engineering where I acquired programming skills across 3 broad areas:
<ol>
<li><b>Native systems programming</b>: 
I started using C at University in 1991 and used it almost exclusively early in my career. 
I have worked on systems written entirely in C, and on systems that combine Java 
with native C libraries via the Java Native Interface (JNI).
</li>
<li><b>Cross-platform development</b>: 
I started learning Java in 1995 and have been using it continuously since 1996.
I have trained new Java developers and taken part in the development of the 
Java platform itself at Sun Microsystems. 
It is the programming language that I have the most experience with,
though I have taken an interest in newer languages that run on the JVM, most notably Scala.
My latest language interest, though, is the Go programming language (Golang).
</li>
<li><b>Scripting</b>: 
While not my primary focus, I do most of my simple shell scripting in Bash and have used some Perl and Python for larger tasks.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Development Platform</h3>
I prefer developing on Linux (Ubuntu) or MacOS where I am most comfortable using command-line tools.
<p>

<h3>Java</h3>
My initial Java programming work centered around building multi-threaded, 
server-side network applications. I also developed client-side implementations 
of FTP and SMTP as well as a number of GUI applications using AWT and Swing.
As part of the Java engineering team at Sun I gained valuable low-level, in-depth
experience in Java. At Oracle I progressed towards developing web applications in Java,
taking a translation source language checker from prototype to production,
then writing Java data extractors for large language translation framework,
before moving on to backend web/micro-services in Java.
At Bank of America I worked on a large ETL system written in Java 
while my work at Jet Engineering involved resilience and instrumentation in Java applications.

<p>
<h3>Scala</h3>
A few years ago I started shifting my career focus towards the Scala programming language and getting familiar with Reactive architecture
as per the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a>.
My Scala experience so far has been develping Spark applications on large datasets to generate reconciliation reports (<a href="#baml">Bank of America</a>)
and to copy real-time and batch on-premise data to the public cloud (<a href="#jet">Jet Engineering</a>).
<p>
<h3>Golang</h3>
Having worked in the Java ecosystem most of my career, the language that grabbed my attention away from the JVM was the Go programming language,
which I started using to develop command-line utilities that interface with web service API endpoints (<a href="#mongodb">MongoDB</a>).
I am drawn towards the simplicity and pragmatism of the language and I am enthusiastic about making Golang the primary focus for my career ahead.

<h2>Career</h2>

<br>
<a name="mongodb"><h3>MongoDB <small>(August 2021 - present)</small></h3></a>
I joined MongoDB to work on the Java backend of their Ops Manager platform, where I have been involved with
the alerts system, modularization of the code base using Bazel, third party library upgrades,
and dealing with customer-facing issues on the regular help rota.
<p>
I also led a project from start to finish on their <code><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongocli">mongocli</a></code> product,
where I got my first experience of programming in Go.
This required me to take an existing product description document to write a scope document, 
followed by a specification document and then implementing the specification with two other engineers on the team.
It also necessitated reaching out to other engineers across teams to get their input along the way. 


<br>
<a name="jet"><h3>Jet Engineering <small>(January 2020 - June 2021)</small></h3></a>
I joined the Merchant Intelligence (MINT)team at Jet Engineering, which had recently been acquired by Walmart.
<p>
The MINT team does backend work gathering data about competitor retail prices
in order to provide fresh information to decision makers in the Pricing team.
<p>
The areas I worked on include:
<ul>
<li>Copying large amounts of real-time and batch data from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud</li>
<li>Adding instrumentation metrics in order to monitor the throughput of systems</li>
<li>Making real-time systems more resilient by incorporating circuit-breakers</li>
</ul>
The technologies and tools I worked with include:
<ul>
<li>Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, Hadoop and Hive for big data</li>
<li>Git, Jenkins and various in-house tools for CI/CD</li>
<li>Prometheus and Grafana for instrumentation/metrics</li>
</ul>


<a name="baml"><h3>Bank of America Merill Lynch <small>(January 2019 - December 2019)</small></h3></a>

I joined the Brexit team in the Reference Data department as a Scala contractor to help 
develop data quality reports related to the financial regulatory requirements that would
come into play once the UK leaves the EU.
<p>
This involved getting familiar with "big data" that is "sqoop'd" daily from various sources in the bank,
into "triplet" data structures (subject-predicate-object) that can be queried using Apache HiveQL,
and then writing Scala code to implement batch queries to be run on Spark, via an in-house Scala library.
<p>
Having delivered all required reports by the original Brexit Day (29 March), I was assigned to 
a team working on a large system that processes and stores Vendor feed data in a more traditional 
architecture, based on Oracle databases and Java.



<a name="oracle"><h3>Oracle <small>(February 2007 - December 2018)</small></h3></a>

I joined the Worldwide Product Translation Group at Oracle in February 2007 as Principal Engineer, 
where I was placed in a team lead role.
<p>
My initial responsibility was to introduce the engineering team to modern tools for version control and
build systems. More specifically, I moved the existing systems from Visual SourceSafe to Subversion,
from Ant to Maven, and introduced continuous build systems such as Cruise Control and, later, Jenkins.
<p>
My first development project was to take an early research prototype of a lint-like translation analysis tool 
and bring it up to production quality by refactoring the source code and bringing it more in
line with actual customer requirements.
<p>
I took the lead for the development of a customer portal, consisting of web and
GUI front-ends for various translation tools, guiding and mentoring other programmers, 
taking responsibility for the project schedule, involving estimates, planning, liaising 
with the Quality Assurance team and internal stakeholders for user acceptance testing.
<p>
I also contributed to the development of a comprehensive terminology management system,
programming some key features such as user authentication using Oracle Single Sign-on,
and importing and exporting terms from and to spreadsheets.
<p>
I then worked on an advanced pseudo-translation tool for the customer portal,
and the backend architecture to make it scale across machines
in a cluster using in-house developed technologies and Grid Engine.
<p>
My focus shifted towards the core translation platform when I developed SGML- and XML-based
parsers to migrate translation content to our in-house system after Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems.
<p>
During my last few years at Oracle I was mostly involved in developing web services around the translation workflow,
as well migrating a monolithic, enterprise web service to a more microservices-based architecture.
<p>
The last project I worked on centered on developing microservices for backend Machine Learning
in the field of Machine Translation, evaluating engines in terms of performance and quality of results.
The microservices were deployed as Docker containers and scaled using Marathon with Mesos on the backend.
I also migrated our microservices source code from Subversion to Git.

<br>
<a name="sun"><h3>Sun Microsystems <small>(April 2001 - January 2007)</small></h3></a>

During almost 6 years at Sun Microsystems in Ireland I worked on the Java platform, the Desktop group and the Sun Ray team.
<p>
<h6>Java</h6>
In April 2001 I joined the software engineering team that developed the reference implementations 
for <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=62">Personal Profile</a> and 
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=129">Personal Basis Profile</a> for J2ME on Linux.
<p>
I did an in-depth study of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) and developed a proof-of-concept 
client-side implementation to provide HTTPS support for J2ME Personal Profile.
This also involved getting familiar with the Java 2 security model, 
including interoperability with the Java Secure Sockets Extension (JSSE) 
and the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE). 
<p>
I familiarised myself with the build system (Make) and source code version
control system (SCCS with Teamware), contributing to the maintenance
of the makefiles, creating and merging workspaces, taking responsibility for the
nightly and weekly bring-overs between the Europe and US offices and ensuring 
that the nightly builds succeeded.
<p>
I developed and maintained a suite of automated performance benchmark tests to ensure 
that we met the required memory/speed limitations of the target platform and to detect 
any performance regressions early.
I also assisted our technical writer with the programmer's guides, for which I developed
a suite of demonstration programs to illustrate a wide range of our product features.
<p>
I was responsible for ensuring that all our source code contained the appropriate
copyright notices and licenses, that all Java code was indented according to the Sun
coding guidelines, and that all code was "scrubbed" to detect any inappropriate language
before release.
<p>
<h6>Java Desktop System</h6>
In 2004 I was offered a position in Sun's Desktop group that was responsible for the 
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>-based Java Desktop System (JDS) on both Solaris and Linux.
<p>
My initial development projects involved mostly Java programming: I did some 
Servlet development for the JDS patch system whereby customers could perform online
updates of their JDS Linux installations. Then I developed a GUI-based product registration 
application for JDS, ensuring that it was internationalised and complied with
export regulations.
<p>
Thereafter I became more involved in GNOME development, writing a gnome-vfs module 
for Network Places, and patching the Nautilus file manager to use it.
<p>
We used CVS for source code control and Make with Autotools to build applications.
I learned the package management system, wrote RPM spec files to build RPM's and 
used Diff to create patches.
I became involved in a project to investigate various Debian-based Linux systems,
documenting the install procedures, as well as comparing the Debian package management
tools with RPM's, and documenting how they would fit into the JDS patch system.
<p>
I evaluated Wiki systems so that our group could create and share documentation in a 
collaborative way. We settled on <a href="http://www.twiki.org/">TWiki</a>, 
which I installed, configured and administered for the group.
<p>
Thereafter I was involved in designing and running network bandwidth performance tests
to measure the size and speed of network traffic between Sun Ray servers and clients
when running JDS. This involved collecting metrics using the command-line tcpdump 
utility while performing specified, repetitive user-interface tasks, and displaying
the results graphically.
<p>
<h6>Sun Ray</h6>
In 2005 I joined the <a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray">Sun Ray</a> team where I
initially investigated Canary: a web-based tool used internally at Sun to monitor 
the overall performance of any number of server and client machines on a network, 
especially where many Sun Ray clients are deployed, providing statistics and an early 
warning facility for operations managers and systems administrators.
<p>
Thereafter I became involved in developing web applications in Java, specifically 
to develop a new web-based user interface for Sun Ray servers, running on Apache's Tomcat 
server.
This involved working with Servlets, Java Server Pages (JSP) and
Java Server Faces (JSF) technologies on the server, and HTML with Cascaded 
Stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript on the client.
I made extensive use of the Java Native Interface (JNI) to access native 
C libraries. I started using Subversion in place of CVS for source code control, and Ant 
in place of Make to build the product.

<a name="traderoot"><h3>TradeRoot Technologies <small>(April 2000 - February 2001)</small></h3></a>
In April 2000 I joined Inference Technologies, which has since become part of
<a href="http://www.traderoot.com/">TradeRoot</a>.
<p>
I worked as a Java developer on a framework for building electronic commerce systems
that integrate proprietary payment protocols with the ISO8583 EFT protocol.
The work involved extensive use of Java threads and network communications using TCP,
UDP and serial ports. I worked on Java code to interface with various hardware
devices such us Schlumberger PIN pads, FastNet radio pads to connect to a wireless
X.25 network, and Pandora ether pads to communicate with serial devices on a LAN.
I also did user interface programming in Swing and used XML to a limited degree. 
<p>
In addition to Java development, I was responsible for version control and
the build system, and I ensured that all our source code complied with the Java 
coding standards as specified by Sun Microsystems. 

<a name="ncrypt"><h3>NCrypt Systems <small>(March 1999 - March 2000)</small></h3></a>
In March 1999 I joined NCrypt Systems, a startup company in the field of computer data security. 
<p>
I was involved in research and development work on distributed object technology
in Java involving CORBA, RMI, object serialization, sockets and
custom classloaders. I also undertook the task of training and mentoring a team of
new graduate developers, and in the process I developed an in-house Java 
training course, which covers the fundamentals of the Java programming language.

<a name="transwitch"><h3>TranSwitch Services <small>(November 1995 - February 1999)</small></h3></a>
In 1995 I joined TranSwitch Services, a joint startup venture between retail giant 
<a href="http://www.pnp.co.za/">Pick 'n Pay</a>, South Africa's largest bank 
<a href="http://www.absa.co.za/">ABSA</a> and <a href="http://www.mosaicsoftware.com/">
Mosaic Software</a> that grew out of PayNet, the pioneers in retail electronic funds 
transfer (EFT) in South Africa.
<p>
I was responsible for the architecture, design and implementation of the 
<a href="http://www.easypay.co.za/">EasyPay</a> system.
Much of the work I did involved "data-crunching": parsing and generating data in various
formats, such as COBOL-style fixed length file formats, comma-separated ASCII text files 
and EDIFACT files, and storing the processed data in a database.
I also ensured that files were received and delivered by various means: X.25, FTP, 
email, hand delivery of magnetic tapes, etc.
<p>
I dealt with a variety of clients and vendors of point-of-sale and billing systems,
with whom I discussed and agreed upon file exchange formats and infrastructure, 
set up test cycles and coordinated their inclusion into the production system.
The EasyPay system went live on 1 June 1997 and processed more than 6 million payments 
in the first 18 months. 
<p>
In addition to the core EasyPay system, which had to be done in C, I developed some 
peripheral utilities in Java to assist the operators and administration staff. 
This exposed me to network programming with TCP/IP sockets, implementing FTP and SMTP 
functionality in standalone client GUI applications and accessing databases using JDBC.
A also wrote a Java applet to generate and print Barcodes.
<p>
In 1998 I started teaching Java beginner classes in the evenings at KryptoPlus, 
a startup training company in my local neighbourhood.

<a name="denel"><h3>Denel Informatics <small>(January 1993 - September 1995)</small></h3></a>
In 1993 I started working for Denel Informatics as a junior C programmer on a store-and-forward 
routed messaging system.
<p>
This exposed me to a wide variety of technologies as the system had to run on a range 
of operating systems (MVS, Unix, OS/2, WindowsNT, DOS), interface with different databases 
(IDMS, DB2, Sybase, Oracle, C-Tree, Paradox) and use various methods of file transfer 
(XCOM, TCP/IP, Floppy).
In less than 3 years I had worked myself up from Junior to Senior Programmer in the team.
<p>
In 1995 I joined the company's Object Oriented products team, who were the official distributors
of NeXTSTEP in South Africa. I learned to program in Objective-C and used tools such as 
InterfaceBuilder on the NeXTSTEP platform, now the core operating system and development
platform on Apple computers.

<p>
Being an academic institution, the focus was more on computer science theory than programming. 
However, in order to apply the theoretical knowledge obtained, the university chose 
Unix and C for all practical programming projects.
My first major C programming project was a course scheduling system, for which I obtained 93%.
Other projects, for which I achieved an average mark of over 80%, included implementing 
data structure algorithms, such as linked lists and height/weight balanced binary trees, 
writing a database relational algebra optimizer, and implementing scheduling and memory 
management modules for a virtual operating system project.
<p>
The computer science courses consisted of modules in:

<a name="ba"><h3>Further Education</h3></a>
I started learning Spanish with the intention of backpacking around Latin America one day.
I enjoyed it so much that I decided to enrol for the Spanish Special course at the
<a href="http://www.unisa.ac.za/">University of South Africa</a>. 
I ended up registering for a full BA degree, majoring in Spanish and Geography. 
I chose Geography as my second major because I take an interest in environmental issues
and I plan to build a sustainable, eco-friendly home running off solar and wind power.
I was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree after having passed the following papers:

<h2>Personal</h2>
<h3>Societies, Clubs and Organizations</h3>
As a child I was a member of the stamp and chess clubs at school, as well as
youth organizations such as the Boys Brigade and Sea Cadets.
<p>
When I worked at SASOL I was a member of the Secunda Hiking club, where I regularly
took part in weekend hikes, led a few hikes and served on the committee.
<p>
At University I belonged to the Mountain and Ski club, regularly partaking in
hiking activities, social gatherings and contributing to the annual club magazine.
<p>
While working in Cape Town I attended some meetings of the Cape Town Linux User Group,
and was involved in setting up a Cape Town Java User Group.
<p>
In 2005 I took a supervised IQ test and, having passed the entrance requirements,
was invited to join the British/Irish Mensa Society.
<p>
In the pre-COVID years I was an active member of the Dublin Argentinian Tango Society,
and I DJ'd at tango events in Dublin, across Ireland and Europe and even further afield.

<h3>Interests, Sports and Hobbies</h3>
<b>Hiking, Camping and Travelling</b> - I backpacked, hiked and travelled around
Southern African countries as a solo traveller in my youth.
More recently my young son and I have done various outdoor adventures:
<ul>
<li>Travelled to remote deserts in Africa</li>
<li>Photographed ice caves and the Aurora Borealis in Iceland.</li>
<li>Hiked and fished trout in Yosemite Valley</li>
<li>Hiked along the highest sea cliffs in Europe and to the summit of Ireland's highest mountain.</li>
<li>Walked the entire 830km Northern "Camino de Santiago" in Spain over 37 days in July 2018.</li>
<li>Cycled over 2000km around Ireland during the summers of 2020 and 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Running, Cycling &amp; Rollerblading</b> - I started running in 1996, and have
since run a few marathons and the Two Oceans ultra-marathon.
In 1998 I did the 105km Argus cycle tour on my mountain bike. 
Since living in Ireland my sporting activities have been limited to roller-blading and cycling,
though I did manage to finish the 2004 Dublin Marathon
<p>
<b>Watersport</b> - When in South Africa, I take to the sea with my bodyboard and wave-ski.
In 1995 I did the NAUI Open Water I scuba diving course, completing my qualifying dives
at Sodwana off the South African east coast. I dived at Knysna to see the Knysna Sea Horse,
among Ragged Tooth sharks at Shark's Gulley near Port Alfred.
More recently I have snorkeled in the Red Sea with my son, and we completed the PADI Open Water Diver scuba certification.
<p>
<b>Gardening</b> - I am the most relaxed in the outdoors when gardening.
Whenever I return to South Africa on holiday, I continue work on establishing an indigenous
garden in Betty's Bay near Cape Town.
<p>
<b>Tango</b> - I started taking Argentinian Tango dance lessons in 2008,
and have subsequently developed a strong love for the dance, the music and Argentinian culture.
In order to improve my dancing further, I have collected and listened to tango music extensively
as I build a reputation as Tango DJ at milongas and tango festivals all over Ireland, Europe and further abroad.
I have visited various cities to dance and DJ: Prague, Barcelona, Edinburgh, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Moscow as well as Buenos Aires.
<p>
<b>Music</b> - With my passion for Tango I picked up my clarinet again to play some
of the classic old Tango music. I selected a few of my favourite songs and started
using the Open Source MuseScore to transfer sheet music and arrange and transpose it
for clarinet. I play the pieces with musician friends in Dublin and with community
tango orchestras in other European cities when I travel to festivals.
<p>
<b>Photography</b> - I chose the Olympus Micro Four Thirds camera system, which I have used to
photograph some of my travels and tango dance events.
<p>
<b>Petanque</b> - Since COVID has curtailed my Tango activities, I have taken up the pasttime of "French Boules",
also known as "Petanque", which I am able practise in a social distancing manner in Dublin parks.

<h3>Reading</h3>
I have an extensive collection of O'Reilly technical books, and I often read about the 
culture, philosophy and ideas of the Free and Open Source Software movements.
Occasionally I enjoy reading books and essays on how we build and manage software 
projects and people. Though I regard these books as insightful, I do not see them
necessarily as "silver bullets", but rather as complementary to good, solid technical
skills. 
<p>
As part of my Spanish studies, I have read a number of Spanish books, short stories
and essays by authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Garcia Lorca and others.
